It's a strange time to be celebrating my acceptance to Brown University given the [recent settlement](https://www.brown.edu/news/2025-07-30/brown-united-states-resolution-agreement) by the university with the Trump Administration. You can read it in full at that link. Here is the bulleted summary we all received on the contents of the agreement:

> 1. Affirming that the government does not have the authority to dictate teaching, learning and academic speech<br><br>
2. Restoration of Brown's medical and health sciences research funding and ability to compete for grants, including reimbursement of more than $50 million in unpaid federal grant costs<br><br>
3. Permanent closure of current open reviews and investigations of the University's federal compliance with antidiscrimination laws, with no finding of wrongdoing<br><br>
4. Brown payment of $50 million in grants over 10 years to Rhode Island workforce development organizations, which is aligned with the University's service mission<br><br>
5. Addressing compliance with Title IX, including "male" and "female" designations for athletics and on-campus housing, consistent with NCAA requirements and Brown’s current policies, as well as provisions on gender-affirming care for minors<br><br>
6. Codifying Brown’s sustained commitment to initiatives, programs and services to ensure a thriving Jewish community, and launching a third-party campus climate survey<br><br>
7. Reaffirming our commitment to compliance with nondiscrimination laws — encompassing admissions and all diversity and inclusion efforts — with requirements for providing data and compliance reports to the government

Some are saying the agreement is not as bad as what Columbia signed, for instance. That's not the point to me. This is protection money, pure and simple.  Trump extorted a private university, illegally, because he could. And Brown let them do so rather than fight it (as, [to everyone's surprise](https://theonion.com/nation-cant-believe-it-on-harvards-side/), Harvard is currently doing). A voluntary agreement which sacrifices the rights of trans students and anti-genocide protestors (among others) does not preserve "academic freedom."

I am not here to write a long piece on this. I am excited to begin my PhD. I am excited to work with incredible and like-minded people in the Anthropology Department at Brown. While the recent developments are infuriating, Brown as a community has a long history of progressive academic inquiry, protest culture, and support for LGBTQ+ rights that will not be so easily snuffed out. That is the Brown I am here to be a part of. Not whatever this is.
