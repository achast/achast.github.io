Just a bit of good news. It's not often that news from my home state cheers me up, but this is great.

Local communities across Indiana have been successful in fighting rezoning that would allow for data centers in their backyards, despite an incredibly AI-friendly state government. Visiting my fianc√©e's hometown of Frankfort, IN just a few weeks ago, I was told that the opposition to a local data center was "the most bipartisan" issue they've ever encountered there.

On an interesting/realist note, this resistance follows a lot of the same arguments (and seems to use many of the same networks) that communities like Frankfort have made against renewable energy projects such as concerns around noise, land use, uneven economic benefits etc. It makes me wonder if lumping in data centers with the renewables industry is more of a broader front against "shiny" industries that seem, at least aesthetically if not economically, opposed to local rural lifeways.

Anyway, a lot to dig into here but community organizing against big tech is a win in my book!
