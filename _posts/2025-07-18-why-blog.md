Blogs seem old fashioned but they represent the very fundamental idea of **owning your own data!**

In the indie web movement, there is an acronym for this: [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE). This stands for "Publish Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere". There are a lot of reasons for this that you can explore in the link, but at it's core it means ownership of your own data and and not relying on social media servers to host your own content.

At the end of the day, even if Github were to die a fiery death, my website data is all saved in Markdown (basically fancy text files) right on my own computer. These files are small, portable, and extremely easy to edit in the Markdown editor of my choice.

I plan to eventually share posts to various socials, but will publish first and foremost right here!
