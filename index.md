subtitle: PhD Student in Anthropology at Brown University

Hi, my name is Coleton and I am a PhD student at Brown University as well as a graduate of National Dong Hwa University's College of Indigenous Studies in Taiwan (東華大學原民會-族群關係). I am a lingusitic anthropologist whose work focuses on language revitalization and reclamation in Taiwan, especially among the Pangcah/'Amis. I am interested in the repercussions of AI on Indigenous and endangered language communities, data colonialism, digital methods and ethnography, as well as enacting decolonial practice.

My master's thesis was a digital ethnography of two open language platforms made in collaboration between open source technology communities and members of the Pangcah/'Amis nation.

### What I am thinking/working on at the moment

- The relationship between small language communities and emergent language technologies ("AI")
    - The ethics of AI in community language work, specifically how data is harvested in the name of "digital equity"
    - How Indigenous communities assert sovereignty and agency in language technology projects
- Indigenous and endangered language documentation, revitalization, and reclamation especially in Taiwan
- Open source software and the communities which use and support it (g0v, Wikipedians)
    - Cooperation between open technology communities and Indigenous/endnagered language communities
