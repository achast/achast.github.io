Hi, my name is Coleton and I am a PhD student at Brown University as well as a graduate of National Dong Hwa University's College of Indigenous Studies in Taiwan (東華大學原民會-族群關係). I am a lingusitic anthropologist whose work focuses on language revitalization and reclamation in Taiwan, especially among the Pangcah/'Amis. 

I am interested in the repercussions of AI on Indigenous and endangered language communities, data colonialism, digital methods and ethnography, as well as decolonial methodologies.

My master's thesis is _Mipaselak to sowal no Pangcah: a digital ethnography of two  open 'Amis language platforms, 'Amis MoeDict and 'Amis Wikipitiya_ and is available via the NDHU Library.
