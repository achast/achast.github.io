Hi, my name is Coleton and I am currently an MA student at National Dong Hwa University in the College of Indigenous Studies. I've just moved to Cambridge, MA and am working as a Program Advisor for EF High School Exchange Year.

### My Research Interests

    - In particular: 'Amis/Pangcah (Formosan, Taiwan), Crow/Aps√°alooke (Siouan, Montana), and Walungge (Tibetic, Nepal)
- Digital ethnography, especially of endangered online language spaces
- Supporting Indigneous sovereignty initiatives in language, culture, land, and data
- Open software/culture research such as Wikipedia and open source communities
 
### What I am up to right now
