Hi, my name is Coleton and I am a recent graduate of National Dong Hwa University's College of Indigenous Studies in Taiwan (東華大學原民會-族群關係). I currently live in Cambridge, MA and work as a high school exchange year program advisor. I volunteer with 7000 Languages a non-profit which provides software resources to Indigenous and endangered languages.

I currently live and work on the lands of the Wôpanâak and Massachusett. Much of my graduate work was performed on the unceded lands of the 'Amis/Pangcah, Sakizaya, and Truku in Taiwan. 

### What I am thinking/working on at the moment

- The relationship between small language communities and emergent language technologies ("AI")
    - The ethics of AI in community language work, specifically how data is collected in the name of "digital equity"
- Indigenous and endangered language documentation, revitalization, and reclamation. In particular:
    - 'Amis/Pangcah (Formosan, Taiwan)
    - Crow/Apsáalooke (Siouan, Montana)
    - Walungge (Tibetic, Nepal)
- Digital ethnography of small languages online
- Revitalization Lexicography and Wikigraphy
- Sovereignty-building practice reclaiming language, culture, land/water, and data
- Open software/culture research such as Wikipedia and open source communities
    - How the designation of open source can "openwash" data colonial practices
