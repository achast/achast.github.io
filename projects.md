## Current Projects
### Mipaselak to sowal no Pangcah: a critical digital ethnography of two online 'Amis/Pangcah open language platforms
This is my current MA thesis research focused on a digital ethnographic description of the 'Amis MoeDict (an online open source 'Amis dictionary maintained by the Taiwanese civic hacking group, g0v) and 'Amis Wikipitiya. My goal in analyzing these two platforms is to look at the intersection of 'Amis language activists and open source/culture organizations, and see how this coalition resolves issues related to language revitalization and reclamation including data sovereignty, equity of language varieties, and language standardization. I analyze these groups as communities of practice, and note how these CoP are motivated by and contribute to specific language ideologies.

### Pongso no Tao Nuclear Colonialism Manuscript
In 2022, I had the great priviledge to attend the NAISA regional gathering at Pongso no Tao (Orchid Island, 蘭嶼) where Tao activists and scholars informed us about the threat that the storage of nuclear waste at Pongso no Tao has had to Tao health, livelihoods, and sovereignty, in addition to the effects of an often exploitative tourism industry. I and other conference participants collaborated to author a shared reaction to our experience, which will likely see publication in the coming months.

### 7000 Languages Data Management Volunteer 
As a soon-to-be Bostonian, I sought out 7000 Languages to get involved with a language revitalization organization based in the area. As a Data Management volunteer, I maintain 7L's internal knowledge-base detailing the many communities they work with, and have served as a liaison between them and Taiwanese Indigenous communities interested in utilizing 7L's software.

## Past Projects
### The Crow Dictionary: Apsáalooke-English
First as an intern (2017-2020), and later as a full-time assistant editor (2020-2021) I contributed to the _Crow Dictionary: Apsáalooke-English_, working with Apsáalooke speakers to add and revise entries in the dictionary. The final dictionary is available for free online and as a mobile app, and features over 11,000 entries with recordings from male and female speakers, morphological breakdowns, example sentences, and cultural background information.

### Fieldwork with Tibetic Languages in Nepal/India
In 2018, I studied abroad in Kathmandu and carried out an independent research project in the Himalayan village, Walung. Walung is home to its own Tibetic language, Walungge, and I was interested in gauging speaker attitudes to their own language in the context of the existing linguistic landscape which included Nepali, Standard Tibetan, Chinese, and other local Tibetic languages. 

In 2019, I continued this research by spending the summer in Dharamsala, enrolling in Tibetan immersion courses and interviewing Tibetans living in Dharamsala about language diversity across areas of the Tibetosphere. I compiled this research into my undergraduate thesis in anthropology at IU, and hope to update/continue it one day.
